# Museum of Candy Landing Page  
This was from the updated Bootstrap 4 section of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy. I typically don't rely on Bootstrap for laying out pages but going through this part of the course showed me the value of having it in my toolbox if needed.  Its super fast to prototype out a page to make it look half way decent while building out the backend.  

I would say the most valuable lesson learned was realizing you don't need to use every single component of Bootstrap.  You can simply apply one concept such as the grid system and apply your own CSS on top to make a finished product.  This page doesn't appear to look like the typical Bootstrap page but has several underlying components.

I will re-visit and re-use Bootstrap in the future.
